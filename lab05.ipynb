    "One possible statistic we can think of is the numbers of players in the defender bins. Are they very similar or drastically different? \n",

    "To get this statistic we apply again our `.groupby` method with respect to multiple columns. To be specific, we want to count the number of shots that were made in each subgroup, compute the probability estimates for field goal percentage, and also compute the average defender distance for the subgroup. You should figure out which functions should be applied to which column after the data is divided into subgroups. The function `.agg()` is crucial for a concise implementation of the above procedures, and its references can be found here:\n",

Intuitively, we would start with counting the number of shots each player attempted, and then create a histogram of shots attempted by these players.

This might be because most players don't get much time on the court, where there are a few superstars who are able to take more than 3 times the average. This would make sense in context of a sports league."
